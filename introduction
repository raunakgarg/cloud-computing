Cloud computing is an amazing technology which provides you the network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, create 
and process data on internet rather than your local servers or personal computers.

for example if you travels from one place to another and you always having some importent data which you have to carry in a pen drive...
sometimes you forgot to bring your pen drive than this situation may be fatel as the data was importent but cloud computing solved this
problem........now with this technology you can store your data into your account on the internet and whrerever you want you can access 
data by just loging in to your account.........this accounts are provided by cloud server companies like amazon(AWS), google(g-drive),
microsoft(onedrive),yahoo(dropbox) etc.
they are having their servers and storage devices which are available to use publically on internet providing some cost.
